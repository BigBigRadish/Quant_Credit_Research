Quants Clamor for Data Causing Soul Searching at Large Banks

By Dani Burger

     (Bloomberg) -- The insatiable demand for unique market data
is putting banks in a tricky situation.
     Quantitative investors, starved for trading signals that
can be spun into gold, are pressuring the finance firms they
work with to grant them access to proprietary information. It’s
easy to see why. In a world where every kernel of publicly
available intelligence is quickly processed and acted upon,
investing advantages can evaporate quickly. In quant speak, the
alpha gets arbitraged away.
     So, to gain a competitive advantage, some systematic
investors are experimenting with peculiar sources, like
satellite images or credit card transactions. Others, however,
see an untapped resource on Wall Street in obscure data sets
that already exist but may not be readily available -- like the
number of clients who read research reports.
     As the cries for valuable new information become deafening,
banks are struggling with a balance. How to offer useful tidbits
without giving away anything sensitive?
     “The buy-side has been after this data for a long time, but
now the drive is getting even more pervasive across the entire
industry as everything gets arbitraged away,” said Benjamin
Dunn, president of the portfolio consulting practice at Alpha
Theory LLC, which works with managers overseeing about $200
billion. “There’s a willingness on the research side to give the
data up, but it’s the compliance and legal side that’s the hold
up.”

                     ‘Extra Sensitive’

     At Credit Suisse, striking that balance has in part fallen
to the new head of quantitative equity research, Matthew
Rothman. Credit Suisse hired Rothman from Acadian Asset
Management last year to serve its growing quant clientele. 
     No stranger to the appeal of untapped data, Rothman and his
team are exploring the possibility of monetizing useful data
that clients are requesting. But they’re still in the early
stages, moving slowly as they evaluate what information would be
appropriate to share, he said.
     “We understand why clients would be interested in this
data, but we’re extraordinarily sensitive to all of our client
concerns about what is appropriate to share,” Rothman said in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “We agree
there’s potential alpha in there, but the question is, who does
that alpha belong to. We’re trying to be helpful while being
extra sensitive. ”
     For many quantitative investors, the holy grail of
automated investing is uncovering a piece of data that can
foreshadow an asset’s rise or fall, giving the fund an
undiscovered edge. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, for
example, purchased information on credit card transactions a few
years ago, while Acadian struck a deal earlier this year to use
big data gathered by Microsoft’s search engine. And investors
regularly use a variety of sources to assess markets such as
energy, mining and real estate development.

                       Protecting Clients

     Data collected by banks and brokers can be even more
appealing: It’s less exotic, with a clearer application. For
example, if Credit Suisse were to make available the number of
clicks its research reports receive, a quant might see an item
on an undervalued company gaining traction and bet the stock
will rise because of the increasing interest.
     To protect some clients and serve others, banks are looking
for ways to make their data sets anonymous without rendering
them useless. Options include aggregating figures or publishing
them with a lag. But that may not be good enough for some
investors.
     “There are certainly banks giving some data, but getting
down to security level detail is something we usually don’t
see,” Dunn said. “In meeting with a couple of them, they have
interesting ownership and flow data, but they’re trying to
figure out what the right level of aggregation is.”

                      Language Processing

     For Credit Suisse, it’s not just about proprietary data,
but also about new technology. For example, Rothman says his
researchers are looking into natural language processing to
capture the tone of reports for more nuanced signals.
     The 51-year-old’s deliberate pace is no mistake. Rothman
knows what it looks like when risky bets go wrong, having
overseen quantitative strategy at Lehman Brothers during the
quant crisis of August 2007, when levered funds tanked amid a
wave of forced selling. Rothman emerged as one of the lead
voices to dissect and explain what happened.
     Today, he champions data less quirky than some of the other
offerings that providers are pushing. For data to be useful, he
said, it should address an existing problem. It can’t just be
random figures that investors have to blindly stumble through.
     “There’s become this fascination with data for the sake of
data,” Rothman said. “Teams are hired to gather this data,
approaching funds who are not quite buying into it and are very
unsure with what to do with it. It’s the cart leading the
horse.”
